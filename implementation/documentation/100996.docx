8.	To check if exit function is working or not.	Exits the program.	Program terminates.



9. Research Work:
The basic idea behind selecting the project was to visualise how the way of functioning and managing the system has totally changed in today’s scenario. With customer interaction increasing day by day, systems are becoming more and more advanced.
Managing money or any valuable assets is a crucial matter for the service provider as well as the clients. Digitization of bank system not only makes work easy but also significantly improves speed of work. Whenever there is sudden and abrupt change in the structure or maintenance and modification is needed all of a sudden, without a proper managing system the development is incomplete.

10. Conclusion:
The bank management system is a user friendly system.It is virtualization of transactions in banking system. All manual process are converted into automated process. It needs a user account number, to access user information and only authorised members are allowed access to the system. Every entry that is made to the system is unique, so that important data of the users is not misplaced. With advancements of technology, proper system needs to be present which can aid customers interact with the system seamlessly and at the same time a proper backup of each and every data is maintained whenever there is a failure so that critical information is not lost.
